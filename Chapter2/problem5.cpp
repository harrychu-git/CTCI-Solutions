/*  Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning
    of the loop.
    DEFINITION
    Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an
    earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
    EXAMPLE
    input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
    output: C   */
